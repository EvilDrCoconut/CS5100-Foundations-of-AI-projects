# CS5100-Foundations-of-AI-projects

This repository is to show others my own work within basic AI/ML projects conducted in the class CS5100 of NorthEastern University. Any questions, please email my current main email (parkhurst.l@northeastern.edu). Thank you for viewing. All code may be used by others if they believe it will help, but requires accreditation to my own work.
